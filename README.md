This package is deprecated in favor of [dart:js][dartjs].

If you are using `package:js` (the old version of this package),
we recommend that you port your code over to `dart:js`.

Usage of `package:js` version <= 0.2.2 can greatly increase the size of
your generated JavaScript.

We are working on a next-generation `package:js`, but if you
need to interop with JavaScript now, please use `dart:js`.
